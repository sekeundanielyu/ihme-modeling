# STI CoD Splits

This code splits STIs based off of the parent model. To launch run the cod_split_data.ado which calls save.do, split_loc_year.do and cod_data_prop.ado.


Debugging Notes: 
I had trouble uploading all sexes at once so I split the calculations into male and female. This sometimes caused a database lock so I upload males first.
