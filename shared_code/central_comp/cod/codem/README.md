CODEm Rewrite 

## This is going to be a rewrite of CODEm with the following goals in mind  
  1. Modularize the code  
    * CODEm should be able to work with any process that involves GBD region data  
    * CODEm should be easy to rewrite so that parts can be swapped in and out  
    * Codem should ultimately just be one function which takes in data and makes predictions  
  2. Make CODEm functions parallel and parameterized  
    * We want to be able to run CODEm quickly and efficiently  
    * CODEm should run many of its procedures in parallel  
  3. Make CODEm well documented and easaliy readable  
    * Make CODEm so that it is legible to outsiders  
    * Document the code so that the algorithms used are explicit
