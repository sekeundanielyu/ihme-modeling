** Start with a dataset with exposure, rrs and tmreds and calculate PAFs. Dataset must be in long
** format for the category variables, and will collapse to a single row for the other id variables.
** Takes four stubs, one each to indicate the beginning of the exposure, rr and tmred  vars and one to 
** indicate the variable you want to store the PAFs in. Also needs a by statement, which tells the id
** variables (besides the variable indicating the category).
** PAF = (SUM(exp_i * RR_i) - SUM(tmred_i * RR_i)) / SUM(exp_i * RR_i)
