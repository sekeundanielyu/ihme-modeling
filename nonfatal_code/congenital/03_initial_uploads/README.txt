This folder contains code that pulls all files generated from the "01_registries" and "02_lit_extractions" folders,
standardizes the data, and uploads by bundle.

This was done separately first for the birth prevalence bundles, then for the full-life course model bundles.
The files saved to the birth prevalence bundles for each modelable entity were ultimately uploaded to each of the full model bundles. 

This folder also contains code that was used to delete the existing data from 2015 models.
