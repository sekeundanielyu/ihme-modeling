# Hardy-Weinberg Transformations

The purpose of this code is the calculate the prevalence of genetic traits based off of prevalence of blood disorders. 

Here is the main idea for the calculations. Let p^2 represent the prevelence of a genetic disease. We can use the Hardy-Weinberg equations 
to calculate the prevelence of carriers. Using the basic equation (p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, along with q=1-p, we can solve for the
2pq term (the carriers). There are some slight variations depending on the hardy_type.
